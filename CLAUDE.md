### Agent Learning System
- **Memory persistence** — All 5 agent memories (Bull, Bear, Trader, Judge, Portfolio Manager) auto-save to `~/.tradingagents/memory/*.json`
- **Auto-load** on every backend startup
- **Reflect & Remember from History** — After a trade closes, click "Log P&L" on the trade:
  - Enter entry/exit prices → calculates P&L
  - Optional "Teach the agent" checkbox → runs reflection
  - 5 agents reflect on what went right/wrong
  - Lessons added to memory, used in future analyses
  - Shows "Agent Memory: N lessons learned" badge on History page
- **Important**: The LLM itself is NOT fine-tuned — memory is keyword-retrieved via BM25 and injected into future prompts as context

### Paper Trading Simulation (FREE)
- **Paper Trades** — Click "Track" on any Top Pick or Recommendation → opens virtual position at current market price
- **Multi-horizon tracking** — auto-fetches actual prices at 1/3/5/10 trading days later

- **Performance by Strategy** — compare win rates across sources (e.g., Recommendations vs Manual vs AI Analysis)
- **Historical Recommender Backtest** — replay recommendation engine on past 60 days, measure actual 5-day outcomes
  - Validates engine quality before risking real money
  - FREE (pure price math, no AI API calls)
  - Persists to `recommender_backtests` table so you can re-view past runs

### Learning Insights (FREE, no ML)
- **Pattern analysis** of all closed trades (paper + real with logged P&L)
- 7 insight categories:
  - Signal Type (STRONG BUY vs BUY vs SELL win rates)
  - Confidence Level (are HIGH picks actually better?)
  - Strategy (which source performs best for you)
  - Seasonality (which months you trade well)
  - Ticker (which stocks you read well/poorly)
  - Indicator (which specific signals work for your style)
  - Direction (long vs short bias)
- Classifies each insight: Strong edge / Works / Average / Marginal / Avoid
- Generates specific actionable tips per insight
- Minimum 3 closed trades required; best with 20+
- **Purpose**: helps YOU learn to filter the agent's output, not train the agent itself

### Settings Management (UI-based)

## Agent Pipeline Flow

```
Market Analyst → Social Analyst → News Analyst → Fundamentals Analyst
    ↓  (any subset can be enabled/disabled via UI)
Bull Researcher ←→ Bear Researcher (debate, 1-3 rounds)
    ↓
Research Manager (judge: Buy/Sell/Hold + trading plan)
    ↓
Trader (entry/SL/target/position size/time horizon)
    ↓
Aggressive ←→ Conservative ←→ Neutral (risk debate, 1-3 rounds)
    ↓
Portfolio Manager (final: Strong Buy/Buy/Hold/Sell/Short)
    ↓
[Optional after trade closes]
Reflect & Remember → 5 agent memories updated with P&L outcome
```

## Configuration

Default config in `tradingagents/default_config.py`. Runtime overrides in SQLite (via Settings UI):

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `llm_provider` | `anthropic` | LLM provider (switch via Settings) |
| `deep_think_llm` | `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` | Complex reasoning (2 agents) |
| `quick_think_llm` | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | Fast tasks (13 agents) |
| `market` | `india` | Market region |
| `default_exchange` | `NSE` | Default exchange |
| `trading_style` | `short_term` | short_term / swing / positional |
| `max_debate_rounds` | `1` | Bull/bear debate iterations (overridable per request) |
| `output_language` | `English` | Report language (English/Hindi) |
| `data_vendors` | `yfinance` | Data source |
| `dry_run` | `True` | Order safety — never executes real orders |
| `memory_dir` | `~/.tradingagents/memory` | Where BM25 memories are persisted |

### Per-Analysis Overrides (from `/analysis` page)
- `analysts: list[str]` — subset of ["market", "social", "news", "fundamentals"]
- `max_debate_rounds: int` — 1 (Shallow), 2 (Medium), or 3 (Deep)
- `max_risk_discuss_rounds: int` — same as debate
- `output_language: str` — "English" or "Hindi"

## Cost & Performance

Actual costs measured by `StatsCallback` per analysis:

| Config | LLM Calls | Tokens | Est. Cost | Duration |
|--------|-----------|--------|-----------|----------|
| Minimal (Market only, Shallow, English) | ~6 | ~20K | ~Rs.8-12 | 1 min |
| Balanced (all 4 analysts, Shallow) | ~17 | ~200K | ~Rs.15-25 | 2-3 min |
| Full (all 4 analysts, Deep) | ~25 | ~400K | ~Rs.50-70 | 4-6 min |
| + Reflect after P&L | +5 | +15K | +Rs.5-10 | +30s |

## Data Layer

`dataflows/interface.py` routes all data calls through `route_to_vendor()`:

- **yfinance** (default) — Free, NSE with `.NS` suffix. OHLCV, fundamentals, news
- **alpha_vantage** — Alternative with API key, auto-fallback
- **nse** — FII/DII activity, bulk deals, delivery % (stubs)

Ticker normalization: `RELIANCE` → `RELIANCE.NS`, `NIFTY50` → `^NSEI`

### News Sources (configurable via `/news` page)
Default RSS feeds:
- MoneyControl (Top News + Business)
- Economic Times (Markets + IPO)
- LiveMint Markets
- Business Standard Markets
- NDTV Profit

Plus custom yfinance search queries (default: "Nifty Sensex", "RBI monetary policy", "FII DII activity", "India GDP inflation", "India rupee forex")

All configurable: enable/disable, add custom RSS URLs, edit queries.

## Recommendation Engine Scoring

The unified engine (`recommender.py`) uses weighted scoring:

**Bullish signals (add points):**
- Volume-confirmed breakout: +3.0 (best signal, 71% historical win rate)
- Volume spike bullish: +2.0
- Near major support: +2.0
- Gap filled (reversal): +1.5
- RSI oversold: +1.5
- Cyclical bullish month: +1.5
- Strong uptrend: +1.0

**Bearish signals (subtract points):**
- Breakdown below support: -2.5
- Volume spike bearish: -2.0
- Near major resistance: -1.5
- Cyclical bearish month: -1.5
- RSI overbought: -1.0
- Strong downtrend: -1.0
- Gap up/down unfilled: -0.5 (historical fade signal)

**Ratings:**
- Score ≥ +4: STRONG BUY
- Score +2 to +4: BUY
- Score -2 to -4: SELL
- Score ≤ -4: STRONG SELL

**Confidence:** based on aligned signal count (HIGH: 4+, MEDIUM: 2-3, LOW: 1)
**Success Probability:** 50% baseline + 4% per score point + 2% per aligned signal (capped 85%)

## Key Patterns

- **Agent creation**: `create_X(llm, memory?) → node_function(state) → dict`
- **Tool routing**: `@tool` wrappers call `route_to_vendor()`
- **State**: `AgentState` TypedDict with all reports, debate states, final decision
- **Memory**: BM25-based similarity matching with **disk persistence** (auto load/save)
- **Stats tracking**: `StatsCallback` extends `BaseCallbackHandler` to track tokens/cost across LangChain/LangGraph calls
- **Streaming**: Graph `stream_mode="values"` → WebSocket events with heartbeats + stats

## Safety

- `dry_run: True` by default — orders are logged, never executed
- `order_execution_enabled: False` — master switch
- Max position value, max loss per trade, max daily loss limits
- Stop-loss required for all trades
- Exchange whitelist (NSE only by default)

## Storage Paths

- SQLite DB: `~/.tradingagents/trading_agent.db` — tables:
  - `watchlist` — saved tickers
  - `analysis_history` — AI analyses with P&L columns
  - `backtest_runs` + `backtest_trades` — AI backtest runs
  - `paper_trades` — virtual trades with multi-horizon P&L + triggered_signals JSON
  - `recommender_backtests` — historical recommender engine replay results
  - `settings` — API keys + LLM config + news sources
- Agent memories: `~/.tradingagents/memory/{bull,bear,trader,invest_judge,portfolio_manager}_memory.json`
- Analysis logs: `~/.tradingagents/logs/` (per-analysis JSON state dumps)

## Smart Filters on Recommendations

### FII/DII Flow Bias (NEW)
- Live NSE data via `nsepython` (cached 1 hour in `fii_dii_history` table)
- `backend/fii_dii.py` — fetcher + manual entry fallback
- `get_market_bias()` returns score adjustment -1.5 to +1.5 based on FII/DII net values
- Recommender's `_apply_market_bias()` adjusts every stock score before classifying
- Dashboard shows banner: today's FII/DII net + 5-day trend + reasoning
- API: `/api/fii-dii/today`, `/history`, `/bias`, `/manual`

### Earnings + Economic Calendar (NEW)
- `backend/calendar_data.py` — hardcoded RBI/Budget/Fed/F&O dates + yfinance earnings fetch
- `get_event_filter_for_ticker()` returns score adjustment for upcoming events
- Recommender's `_apply_event_filter()` penalizes stocks with imminent events
- Earnings (≤2 days): -2.5 | Budget (≤1 day): -2.0 | RBI (≤1 day): -1.5 | FOMC (≤2 days): -1.0 | F&O expiry today: -0.5
- Dashboard banner shows today's events + 14-day forecast
- API: `/api/calendar/today`, `/upcoming`, `/ticker/{ticker}`, `/refresh-earnings`

### Sector Concentration Checker (NEW)
- `backend/concentration.py` — reverse-maps tickers to sectors, tracks open positions
- `get_open_positions()` — aggregates active paper trades + open analysis trades
- `get_concentration_summary()` — risk level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) + per-sector breakdown
- `check_new_trade_concentration()` — penalty if a new trade would breach limits
- Default limits: max 3 positions/sector, max 30% capital/sector
- Recommender's `_apply_concentration_filter()` only applied to BULLISH signals
- Dashboard widget with stacked bar showing sector allocation
- API: `/api/concentration/summary`, `/allocation`, `/check/{ticker}`, `/positions`

### Signal Performance Tracker (NEW)
- `backend/signal_performance.py` — analyzer + auto-tuner for recommender weights
- Reads `paper_trades` with `pnl_5d_pct IS NOT NULL`, explodes the `triggered_signals` JSON, credits/blames each signal that fired
- Win logic: BULLISH signal wins when 5d P&L > 0; BEARISH/FADE wins when < 0 (multi-attribution — every signal in a trade gets one observation)
- Wilson lower bound at 80% CI used for honest small-sample estimates (avoids over-reacting to lucky streaks)
- `compute_signal_performance(window_days=90)` returns per-signal: n, wins, losses, win_rate, wilson_lower_80, avg_return_5d_pct, current_weight, suggested_weight, delta, verdict (TUNE_UP / TUNE_DOWN / KEEP / INSUFFICIENT_DATA)
- `apply_tuned_weights()` persists suggestions to `settings.recommender_tuned_weights` (JSON dict)
- `recommender.py` calls `_refresh_active_weights()` at start of every `recommend()` — merges DEFAULT_WEIGHTS with tuned overrides into module-level `_ACTIVE_WEIGHTS`. All scoring inside `_analyze_stock` reads from `_ACTIVE_WEIGHTS`, so the engine literally rewrites itself from real outcomes
- Min sample size: 10 trades per signal before any change is suggested
- Suggestion formula: `new_mag = abs(current) * clamp((wilson_lower - 0.30) / 0.20, 0, 2.5)`, sign preserved, clipped to [0, 3.5]
- Frontend: `/signals` page — full per-signal table with current vs suggested weights, "Apply Suggested Weights" button, "Reset to Defaults"
- API: `GET /api/signal-performance/?window_days=N`, `GET /active-weights`, `POST /apply`, `POST /reset`

### Memory Pruning + Decay — Tier 4.2 (NEW)
- `tradingagents/agents/utils/memory.py` rewritten to v2 schema:
  - Each entry now: `{situation, recommendation, created_at, last_accessed, hit_count}`
  - Backward-compat: legacy `documents`+`recommendations` array files auto-migrate on load (timestamped with current time + zero hits, console logs the migration)
  - Disk format keeps both legacy mirror keys AND new `entries` array, schema_version=2
  - `documents` and `recommendations` exposed as `@property` for any caller still using them
- Decay formula: `score = max(0, bm25_score) × decay_factor`
  - Grace period: ≤30 days → 1.0
  - Linear decay: 30→365 days drops from 1.0 to 0.2 floor
  - Frecency bonus: 1.25× if `last_accessed` within 7 days
  - `_decay_factor()` is the single source of truth
- `get_memories()` now updates `last_accessed` + `hit_count` on retrieved entries (only when score > 0 — prevents irrelevant entries from inflating hit count)
- New methods: `prune(max_age_days, min_hits, min_decay, dry_run)`, `delete_entry(index)`, `list_entries()`, `stats()`
- Module-level helpers: `list_all_memory_stats()`, `prune_all_memories()` for cross-agent ops
- `backend/routers/memory.py` — admin REST API: `GET /api/memory/`, `GET /{name}/entries`, `POST /{name}/prune`, `POST /prune-all`, `DELETE /{name}/entry/{index}`
- Frontend `/memory-admin` page:
  - Per-agent stat grid (total, active, decayed, stale, never_hit, avg_decay, oldest age)
  - Pruning form with three optional criteria + Preview (dry-run) + Prune All buttons
  - Click an agent card to inspect entries (situation + lesson previews, age, decay color-coded, hit count, delete button)
- Bug fix during build: BM25 returns negative scores for below-average matches; multiplying negatives by smaller decay would invert ranking. Fixed by `max(0, score)` before applying decay.

### Conditional Regime Weights — Tier 4.1 (NEW)
- `backend/signal_performance.py` extended:
  - `compute_regime_conditional_weights(window_days)` — per-regime suggested overrides
  - `apply_regime_weights(only_regimes)` — persist to `settings.recommender_regime_weights` (JSON: `{"BULL": {...}, "BEAR": {...}, "SIDEWAYS": {...}, "HIGH_VOL": {...}}`)
  - `get_active_weights_for_regime(regime)` — three-layer merge: DEFAULT → base tuned → regime override
  - Conservative thresholds: `MIN_SAMPLE_PER_REGIME=5`, `REGIME_OVERRIDE_THRESHOLD=0.10`, delta>=0.25
- `backend/recommender.py` modified:
  - `_refresh_active_weights()` now detects current regime via `market_regime.get_current_regime()` and applies the matching layer
  - Module-level `_ACTIVE_REGIME` tracks which regime's weights are loaded
  - `recommend()` response includes `active_regime` + `regime_weight_overrides_active` count
- Frontend:
  - `/signals` page has new "Conditional Regime Weights (Tier 4.1)" section with 4-card grid (one per regime), Apply All / Reset buttons
  - `TodayPicks.tsx` header shows `NIFTY100 · HIGH_VOL ⚡N` where N is active override count
- API additions:
  - `GET /api/signal-performance/regime-suggestions?window_days=N`
  - `GET /api/signal-performance/regime-active`
  - `POST /api/signal-performance/regime-apply` (body: `{window_days, only_regimes?}`)
  - `POST /api/signal-performance/regime-reset`
- Smoke test: HIGH_VOL active, applied 1 override (rsi_overbought -1.0 → 0.0 from 5 trades, 40% WR), recommend response confirmed `regime_weight_overrides_active: 1`

### Shadow Trades / Counterfactual Learning (NEW)
- `backend/shadow_trades.py` + `shadow_trades` table — auto-tracks every STRONG BUY (and HIGH-conf BUY) the recommender produces, regardless of whether user clicked Track
- Hooked into `recommend()` in `backend/recommender.py` — after each call, idempotent insert (PRIMARY KEY ticker+signal_date) records picks
- `record_shadow_trades_from_recommendations(recs)` filters to STRONG BUY (any HIGH/MEDIUM conf) + BUY with HIGH conf only; skips noise from MEDIUM-conf BUYs
- `refresh_shadow_prices()` — backfills 1/3/5/10d prices via yfinance, computes pnl_*_pct; auto-runs whenever paper-trade `refresh_paper_trade_prices()` is called
- `shadow_vs_user_comparison()` — compares win rate of all shadows vs user-tracked subset vs skipped subset; verdict: filter_helps / filter_hurts / filter_neutral / insufficient_data (needs ≥5 in tracked + skipped buckets)
- `user_tracked` flag set to 1 if user opened a paper_trade for the ticker on the same day
- Reuses `_price_n_days_later()` from simulation.py for backfill (consistent with paper trades)
- Frontend `/shadow-trades`:
  - Verdict pill ("Filter HURTS" / "Filter HELPS" / etc.) with explanation

### Confidence Calibration / Brier Score (NEW)
- `backend/confidence_calibration.py` — measures whether recommender's `success_probability` is honest
- Reads closed paper_trades with non-null `pnl_5d_pct` and `success_probability`
- Brier score = mean((predicted - actual)²); win = pnl_5d_pct > 0
- Quality bands: ≤0.15 excellent, ≤0.20 good, ≤0.25 fair (50% baseline), >0.25 poor
- Reliability bins: [40-50%, 50-60%, 60-70%, 70-80%, 80-90%, 90-100%]; per bin shows predicted_avg, actual_win_rate, gap
- Verdict from overall gap (actual - predicted): <-0.05 overconfident, >+0.05 underconfident, else well_calibrated
- Improvement % vs always-predict-50% baseline (0.25 Brier) tells you if the model has real signal
- Frontend `/confidence-calibration` page:
  - Headline metrics (verdict, Brier, improvement %, sample size, predicted vs actual)
  - Reliability diagram with paired blue (predicted) + gold (actual) bars per bin
  - Per-bin breakdown table with gap column color-coded
  - 6-step "How to use this page" callout
- API: `GET /api/confidence-calibration/?window_days=N`

### Market Regime Classifier (NEW)
- `backend/market_regime.py` — labels every trading day as one of:
  - `BULL`: Nifty > 50 SMA > 200 SMA, normal vol
  - `BEAR`: Nifty < 50 SMA < 200 SMA, normal vol
  - `SIDEWAYS`: SMAs not aligned (mixed trend)
  - `HIGH_VOL`: realized 20d vol > 1.5× the 120d-avg baseline (overrides trend label)
- `paper_trades.regime_at_entry` column populated automatically on every new trade insert
- `backend/regime_backfill.py` tags historical trades by classifying their entry_date once per unique date (cached)
- `compute_signal_performance_by_regime()` in `signal_performance.py` splits each signal's win rate by regime — surfaces "regime-dependent" signals (spread > 20% with n≥5 in 2+ regimes)
- Frontend:
  - `RegimeBadge` component on Dashboard — color-coded card showing current regime + reasoning + how it affects signal reliability
  - "Regime-Conditional Win Rates" section on `/signals` page — per-signal grid (BULL / BEAR / SIDEWAYS / HIGH_VOL columns) with spread + ⚡ flag for regime-dependent signals
- API: `GET /api/regime/current`, `GET /api/regime/on?d=YYYY-MM-DD`, `POST /api/regime/backfill-trades`, `GET /api/regime/signal-performance`

### Verdict Calibration (NEW)
- `backend/verdict_calibration.py` — measures whether the daily verdict actually predicts Nifty
- `verdict_history` table in `backend/db.py` — one row per snapshot day with verdict, flags, Nifty close, forward closes at 1/3/5 trading days, and outcome classification
- `snapshot_today()` saves today's verdict + Nifty close (idempotent — skips if already taken). Called automatically inside the `/api/daily-verdict/` route so loading the dashboard captures the snapshot
- `backfill_outcomes()` fills in forward Nifty closes when ripe (1/3/5 trading days passed) and classifies each horizon
- Outcome rules:
  - GREEN: correct if Nifty return > +0.10%, wrong if < -0.10%, neutral otherwise
  - RED: correct if Nifty return < -0.10%, wrong if > +0.10%, neutral otherwise
  - YELLOW: correct if abs(return) <= 0.50% (a quiet day matches the call), else wrong
- Accuracy = correct / (correct + wrong); neutrals excluded so noise doesn't pollute
- `compute_calibration(window_days=90)` returns per-verdict counts, avg returns at each horizon, accuracy %, and recent snapshot history
- Frontend: `/verdict-calibration` page — accuracy table by verdict + recent snapshots with per-horizon outcome icons (✓/✗/—)
- API: `GET /api/verdict-calibration/?window_days=N`, `POST /snapshot`, `POST /backfill`

### Daily Trading Verdict (NEW)
- `backend/daily_verdict.py` — synthesizes all 4 filters into ONE decision
- Inputs (each contributes a caution flag, favorable flag, or nothing):
  1. FII/DII bias — caution if BEARISH, favorable if BULLISH (HIGH confidence amplifies)
  2. Calendar events (next 3 days) — caution for FOMC ≤2 days, RBI ≤1 day, Budget ≤1 day, F&O expiry today, earnings ≤2 days
  3. Sector concentration — caution if HIGH/MEDIUM risk on open positions
  4. Live HIGH-conviction setup count (NIFTY 50 recommend) — favorable if ≥3, caution if 0
- Decision table (caution count → favorable count → outcome):
  - `caution ≥3` → RED skip-day (0% size, 0 trades, HIGH only)
  - `caution = 2` → RED stand-down (0% size, 0 trades, HIGH only)
  - `caution = 1, fav = 0` → YELLOW selective (50% size, 2 trades, HIGH only)
  - `caution = 1, fav ≥1` → YELLOW selective (75% size, 3 trades, HIGH only)
  - `caution = 0, fav ≥2` → GREEN aggressive (100% size, 5 trades, MEDIUM ok)
  - `caution = 0, fav = 1` → GREEN normal (100% size, 4 trades, MEDIUM ok)
  - `caution = 0, fav = 0` → YELLOW quiet-day (75% size, 2 trades, HIGH only)
- Caution is weighted over favorability — code at `backend/daily_verdict.py:130-178`
- Output shape: `{verdict, label, action, caution_flags[], favorable_flags[], recommended_position_size_pct, max_trades_today, min_conviction_required, reasoning, filter_results}`
- Headline card at TOP of Dashboard (between Market Status and FII/DII banner)
- API: `GET /api/daily-verdict/`
