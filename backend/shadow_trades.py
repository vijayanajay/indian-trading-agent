"""Shadow Trades — counterfactual learning.

Every time the recommender produces a STRONG BUY (or HIGH-confidence BUY), we
auto-record it here as a 'shadow trade' regardless of whether the user clicked
Track. After 1/3/5/10 trading days, we backfill the actual price moves.

Why this matters:
- Currently we only learn from trades the user opened. Every STRONG BUY they
  ignored is hidden data.
- After 30 days you can compare:
    - Shadow trades win rate (recommender's ground truth)
    - User-tracked trades win rate
  If shadows > user-tracked, the user is filtering out winners.
- If the user systematically ignores certain tickers/sectors, this surfaces
  whether that filter actually helps.

Idempotency: PRIMARY KEY (ticker, signal_date) means calling recommend()
multiple times in a day only records one shadow per ticker.
