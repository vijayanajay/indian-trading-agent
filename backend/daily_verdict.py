"""Daily Trading Verdict — synthesizes all filters into a single trade-or-skip decision.

Combines:
1. FII/DII flow bias
2. Today's calendar events (RBI, Fed, Budget, expiry)
3. Sector concentration risk
4. Quick recommendation count (how many high-conviction setups exist)

Outputs one of:
- GREEN ("TRADE"): aggressive day, multiple setups available
- YELLOW ("SELECTIVE"): caution, only HIGH conviction trades
- RED ("STAND DOWN"): too risky, skip or paper trade only

This is the "what should I actually do today" answer that ties everything together.
