## Attribution

This project is built on top of the excellent [TradingAgents](https://github.com/TauricResearch/TradingAgents) framework by TauricResearch. The core multi-agent LLM pipeline — including the LangGraph orchestration, agent prompts, memory/reflection system, and data vendor abstraction — is directly derived from their work under the Apache 2.0 license.

**Original paper**: [TradingAgents: Multi-Agents LLM Financial Trading Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20138) (Xiao et al., 2024)

**What's adapted for Indian markets in this fork:**
- NSE/BSE ticker support (`.NS` / `.BO` suffixes)
- Indian market news queries (RBI policy, FII/DII, NIFTY)
- IST market hours + NSE holidays calendar
- Indian risk factors in agent prompts (circuit limits, FII/DII flows, SGX cues)
- Short-term trading focus (vs long-term in original)

**What's added on top:**
- Full Next.js web UI (trading terminal) — the original ships a CLI only
- FastAPI backend with WebSocket streaming
- Market Scanner (Gap / Volume / Breakout detection)
- Unified Recommendation Engine (combines 10+ signals into ranked trade ideas)
- **Daily Trading Verdict** — synthesizes all filters into single TRADE / SELECTIVE / STAND DOWN decision
- **FII/DII Daily Flow Tracker** — live institutional buy/sell data adjusts all recommendations
- **Earnings + Economic Calendar** — RBI policy, Budget, FOMC, F&O expiry, per-stock earnings dates filter recommendations
- **Sector Concentration Checker** — prevents over-exposure to single sector (max 3 positions / 30% capital per sector)
- Support/Resistance & Pivot Point calculator
- Cyclical Pattern analysis (monthly seasonality, sector rotation, day-of-week)
- Strategy Performance Tracker (measures historical win rates)
- Paper Trading Simulation (multi-horizon P&L tracking, no API cost)
- Historical Recommender Backtest (replay engine on past 60 days)
- Learning Insights (pattern analysis on YOUR trades, no ML)
- **Signal Performance Tracker** — measures real win rate of each recommender signal from closed trades to diagnose performance (closes the feedback loop)
- **Verdict Calibration** — daily snapshot of the headline verdict + Nifty close, then 1/3/5-day forward returns measure whether GREEN/YELLOW/RED actually predict market direction
- **Market Regime Classifier** — labels every trading day BULL / BEAR / SIDEWAYS / HIGH_VOL, tags every paper trade with the regime at entry, and reveals which signals are regime-dependent (e.g., "Near Support" might win 70% in BULL but 35% in BEAR)
- **Confidence Calibration (Brier score)** — measures whether the recommender's stated `success_probability` is honest. Reliability diagram bins predictions by probability and compares to actual win rate. Flags overconfidence/underconfidence.
- **Shadow Trades** — every STRONG BUY (and HIGH-confidence BUY) auto-recorded as a virtual trade regardless of whether the user clicked Track. After 1/3/5/10 days, actual P&L backfills. Surfaces false negatives — winners the user wrongly skipped — and tells you whether your filtering helps or hurts.
- **Automated Probabilistic Modeling** — recommendation outcomes are fed into a trained L1-regularized logistic regression model that automatically fits coefficients for 17 signals, 4 regimes, and interaction terms to output calibrated success probabilities.
- **Memory Pruning + Decay (BM25)** — agent BM25 memories now carry per-entry metadata (created_at, last_accessed, hit_count). Every retrieval applies an age-based decay multiplier so old lessons fade out automatically. Manual pruning (by age, hit count, or decay floor) physically removes stale entries. Lessons learned in a 2024 bull market no longer pollute 2026 decisions.
- Seasonal Backtest (no AI cost)
- Position Size Calculator
- P&L Tracking + "Reflect & Remember" (feed outcomes to agent memory)
- Memory Persistence (agents learn across sessions)
- Customizable News Feed (RSS + yfinance)
- API key management via UI
- Multi-provider LLM support with real-time cost tracking

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.10+**
- **Node.js 20+**
- An LLM API key (Anthropic/OpenAI/Google — Anthropic Haiku is the cheapest default)

### 1. Clone and install Python deps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/indian-trading-agent.git
cd indian-trading-agent

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -e .
pip install fastapi uvicorn websockets aiosqlite numpy feedparser
```

### 2. Configure API key (pick ONE method)

**Option A: via UI** (recommended — easier, no env setup)

Start the app, then go to **Settings** → API Keys → paste your key → Test → Save.
Keys are stored in your local SQLite DB (`~/.tradingagents/trading_agent.db`).

**Option B: via `.env` file**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your key:
#   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-...
```

### 3. Start everything (one command)

```bash
./start.sh
```

This script:
- Frees ports 8000 and 3000 if anything's already running
- Starts the backend (uvicorn) on :8000
- Starts the frontend (Next.js) on :3000
- Waits for both to be healthy
- Opens [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser
- Tails both logs in one terminal (color-coded by service)
- Cleans up both processes on `Ctrl+C`

Override ports via env vars: `BACKEND_PORT=9000 FRONTEND_PORT=3001 ./start.sh`

<details>
<summary>Or start them manually (two terminals)</summary>

```bash
# Terminal 1 — backend
uvicorn backend.app:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2 — frontend
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev

# Then open http://localhost:3000
```
</details>

## How It Works

### The Multi-Agent Pipeline

```
Market Analyst → Social Analyst → News Analyst → Fundamentals Analyst
    ↓  (any subset can be enabled/disabled)
Bull Researcher ←→ Bear Researcher (debate, 1-3 rounds)
    ↓
Research Manager (judge: Buy/Sell/Hold + trading plan)
    ↓
Trader (entry/SL/target/position size/time horizon)
    ↓
Aggressive ←→ Conservative ←→ Neutral (risk debate, 1-3 rounds)
    ↓
Portfolio Manager (final: Strong Buy/Buy/Hold/Sell/Short)
    ↓
[Optional after trade closes]
Reflect & Remember → 5 agent memories updated with actual P&L outcome
```

### Features — Free vs LLM API Cost

> **Note on costs**: The software itself is free and open source. "Cost" below refers to the **LLM API usage fees** you pay directly to your chosen AI provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, etc.) for the features that call their APIs. You bring your own API key. Nothing is charged by this project or its authors — all billing is between you and your LLM provider.

| Feature | Uses LLM API? | Est. Cost per Run | What it does |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Top Picks** | No | FREE | Ranks NIFTY 50/100/BSE 250 stocks by combined signal strength |
| **Market Scan** | No | FREE | Finds stocks with gap ups/downs, volume spikes, breakouts |
| **Strategies** | No | FREE | S/R levels, Pivot Points, Cyclical patterns |
| **Performance Tracker** | No | FREE | Measures historical win rate of each strategy |
| **Seasonal Backtest** | No | FREE | Tests "buy in month X, sell in month Y" strategies |
| **News Feed** | No | FREE | Aggregates Indian market news from RSS + yfinance |
| **Charts** | No | FREE | Candlestick charts with volume |
| **Deep Analysis** | Yes | ~Rs.15-60 (~$0.18-0.72 USD) | Full AI pipeline with customizable analysts/depth/language |
| **AI Backtest** | Yes | ~Rs.15 per date (~$0.18/date) | Runs deep analysis on historical dates |
| **Reflect & Remember** | Yes | ~Rs.5-10 per trade | Agent learns from your P&L outcome |

Costs shown assume the default Anthropic Claude setup (Haiku for fast tasks + Sonnet for decisions). Switching to cheaper providers like Gemini Flash or GPT-4o-mini can reduce costs by 3-5x. See [Cost Optimization](#cost-optimization) below.

### Unified Recommendation Engine (FREE)

Scans all stocks in NIFTY 100 and scores each one:

**Bullish signals add points:**
- Volume-confirmed breakout: +3.0
- Volume spike bullish: +2.0
- Near major support: +2.0
- Gap filled (reversal): +1.5
- RSI oversold: +1.5
- Cyclical bullish month: +1.5
- Strong uptrend: +1.0

**Bearish signals subtract:**
- Breakdown below support: -2.5
- Volume spike bearish: -2.0
- Near major resistance: -1.5
- RSI overbought: -1.0
- Strong downtrend: -1.0

Ratings: STRONG BUY (score ≥ +4), BUY (+2 to +4), SELL (-2 to -4), STRONG SELL (≤ -4).

Success probability: 50% baseline + 4% per score point + 2% per aligned signal (capped at 85%).

### Smart Filters Layered on Top (FREE)

Two market-wide filters automatically adjust every recommendation before showing it to you:

**1. FII/DII Institutional Flow** — In Indian markets, the single biggest predictor of next-day direction:

| Today's Flow | Score Adjustment | Effect |
|-------------|------------------|--------|
| FII selling > Rs.2,000 Cr | -1.5 | Demotes BUYs to NEUTRAL |
| FII selling > Rs.1,000 Cr | -1.0 | Reduces conviction |
| FII buying > Rs.2,000 Cr | +1.5 | Promotes BUYs to STRONG BUY |
| FII buying > Rs.1,000 Cr | +1.0 | Adds tailwind |
| DIIs partially offsetting | +0.5x reduction | "Mixed" bias |

Live data via NSE (cached 1 hour). Falls back to manual entry if scraping fails.

**2. Earnings + Economic Calendar** — Avoids trading into known volatility:

| Event in Next N Days | Score Penalty |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Stock earnings (≤2 days) | -2.5 |
| Union Budget (≤1 day) | -2.0 |
| RBI Monetary Policy (≤1 day) | -1.5 |
| US Fed FOMC (≤2 days) | -1.0 |
| F&O monthly expiry (today) | -0.5 |

Hardcoded RBI/Budget/Fed dates (published yearly). Per-stock earnings dates pulled from yfinance.

**3. Sector Concentration Checker** — Prevents over-exposure to one sector:

| State | Penalty |
|-------|---------|
| Adding trade would breach 30% sector limit | -1.5 |
| Adding trade would exceed 3 positions per sector | -1.5 |
| Approaching 80% of limit | -0.5 |

Tracks paper trades + open analysis trades. Stops AI from giving you 5 STRONG BUYs all in IT sector (which would be one concentrated bet, not five separate trades).

**Real example:** On a day when FIIs sold Rs.8,000 Cr and INFY has earnings tomorrow:
- Pure technical score: STRONG BUY (+5.0)
- After FII filter: BUY (+3.5)
- After earnings filter: NEUTRAL (+1.0) — filtered out

This prevents the most common AI trading mistakes: trading against institutional flow + trading into earnings volatility + accidental sector concentration.

### The Daily Verdict (top of Dashboard)

All 3 filters above plus a live HIGH-conviction setup count are synthesized into a **single decision** at the top of the Dashboard.

**The 4 inputs** (each contributes a caution flag, favorable flag, or nothing):

| # | Input | Source | Triggers |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | FII/DII flow | live NSE via `nsepython` | Caution if FIIs net sellers · Favorable if heavy buyers |
| 2 | Calendar events (next 3 days) | hardcoded RBI/Budget/Fed + yfinance earnings | Caution for FOMC ≤2 days, RBI ≤1 day, Budget ≤1 day, F&O expiry today |
| 3 | Sector concentration | open paper + analysis trades | Caution if portfolio at sector limit (3 positions or 30% capital) |
| 4 | HIGH-conviction setup count | recommender on NIFTY 50 | Favorable if ≥3 STRONG BUY+HIGH · Caution if 0 |

**Decision table** (`backend/daily_verdict.py:130-178`):

| Caution | Favorable | Verdict | Position Size | Max Trades | Min Conviction |
|--------:|----------:|---------|--------------:|-----------:|----------------|
| ≥3 | any | 🔴 RED — Skip the day | 0% | 0 | HIGH |
| 2 | any | 🔴 RED — Stand down | 0% | 0 | HIGH |
| 1 | 0 | 🟡 YELLOW — Selective | 50% | 2 | HIGH |
| 1 | ≥1 | 🟡 YELLOW — Selective | 75% | 3 | HIGH |
| 0 | ≥2 | 🟢 GREEN — Aggressive | 100% | 5 | MEDIUM |
| 0 | 1 | 🟢 GREEN — Trade normally | 100% | 4 | MEDIUM |
| 0 | 0 | 🟡 YELLOW — Quiet day | 75% | 2 | HIGH |

Caution is weighted over favorability deliberately — losing money to an unexpected FOMC reaction is worse than missing one good day.

The card shows: position size %, max trades, min conviction, the specific action (*"Don't open new positions. Manage existing only."*), and every flag with reasoning.

This is the **"what do I actually do today?"** answer — eliminates daily decision paralysis.

### The Feedback Loop (closes the learning cycle)

The system improves itself from real trade outcomes. Two pages drive this:

#### 📈 Signal Performance — diagnoses recommender signals

Every paper trade stores which signals fired (`triggered_signals` JSON). After 5-day P&L is known, each signal is credited or blamed for the outcome (multi-attribution — every signal in a trade gets one observation).

Aggregated stats per signal:

| Stat | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `n` | Number of closed trades the signal appeared in |
| `win_rate` | Raw fraction that won |
| `wilson_lower_80` | Honest lower bound at 80% confidence — handles small samples |
| `avg_return_5d_pct` | Mean realized return when the signal fired |
| `base_weight` | Default weight assigned to the signal in scoring |

The manual and regime-specific weight tuning override endpoints have been retired. The recommendation engine now uses these statistics as informational diagnostics, and the system is powered by an automated **L1-regularized logistic regression probabilistic model** to predict success probabilities and drive position sizing.

#### 🎯 Verdict Calibration — grades the daily verdict

Every dashboard load snapshots today's verdict + Nifty close into `verdict_history`. After 1/3/5 trading days, forward closes backfill and outcomes are classified:

| Verdict | Correct when | Wrong when |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| GREEN | Nifty return > +0.10% | < -0.10% |
| RED | Nifty return < -0.10% | > +0.10% |
| YELLOW | abs(return) ≤ 0.50% (quiet day) | > 0.50% |

Accuracy = `correct / (correct + wrong)`. Neutrals are excluded so ±0.05% noise doesn't pollute the score.

After ~30 days of data, the calibration table reveals whether the headline filter is genuinely predictive or whether thresholds need retuning. Example output:

```
GREEN  8 days  +0.4% avg 5d  67% accuracy  ✓ trustworthy
YELLOW 9 days  +0.1% avg 5d  71% quiet-day accuracy  ✓ identifies low-edge days
RED    5 days  +0.3% avg 5d  40% accuracy  ✗ over-cautious — loosen thresholds
```

Both pages live under **VALIDATE** in the sidebar. Together they close the full loop: real trades → measured outcomes → updated weights + calibrated thresholds → smarter recommendations.

#### ⚡ Market Regime Classifier — conditional signal performance

Solves the "signal averaging" problem: a signal might win 70% in bull markets and 35% in bear, but the lifetime average of 52% is mush.

Every trading day is classified into one of four regimes:

| Regime | Trigger | What it means for trading |
|--------|---------|---------------------------|
| 🟢 **BULL** | Nifty > 50 SMA > 200 SMA, normal vol | Trend favors longs. Breakout signals reliable. |
| 🔴 **BEAR** | Nifty < 50 SMA < 200 SMA, normal vol | Trend favors shorts. Bounce signals fail more often. |
| 🟡 **SIDEWAYS** | SMAs not aligned (mixed trend) | Range-bound. Mean-reversion works, breakouts fakeout. |
| 🟣 **HIGH_VOL** | Realized 20d vol > 1.5× the 120d baseline | Extreme moves dominate. Reduce size, most signals less reliable. Overrides the trend label. |

The Dashboard has a color-coded **Regime Badge** showing today's classification + the volatility readout (e.g., *"Vol 18.5% (baseline 10.4%)"*).

Every paper trade is tagged with `regime_at_entry` automatically. The `/signals` page splits each signal's win rate by regime in a 4-column grid:

```
Signal                      BULL    BEAR    SIDE    HIGH    Spread
Volume Spike (Bullish)      75%     25%     57%     43%     50%   ⚡ regime-dependent
                            (12)    (4)     (7)     (8)
Breakout (Vol Confirmed)    72%     65%     68%     58%     14%   works across regimes
                            (15)    (8)     (9)     (12)
```

Signals with **spread > 20%** (and n≥5 in 2+ regimes) are flagged ⚡ **regime-dependent** — meaning the blanket weight in the main signal table is misleading. You should only act on these signals when the favorable regime is active.

How to use it day-to-day:

1. Glance at the Dashboard regime badge before trading.
2. Open `/signals`, scroll to the regime breakdown.
3. For each ⚡ signal you care about, note which regime it works in.
4. Manually skip those signals when the wrong regime is active.

**Regime-conditional diagnostics are now live** (Tier 4.1) — the recommender displays per-regime diagnostics automatically on `/signals` to reveal which signals are regime-dependent. 

#### 🎚️ Automated Regime Calibration

The backend uses a 28-dimensional logistic model featuring interaction terms between signals and regimes (e.g., how "Near Support" behaves in "HIGH_VOL" vs "BULL"). The model automatically learns these coefficients and outputs calibrated success probabilities that dynamically factor in the active regime at runtime. Manual regime weight overrides are deprecated and retired.

The Dashboard's Top Picks header shows the active regime + override count: `NIFTY100 · HIGH_VOL ⚡3` means 3 regime-specific overrides are active right now. Hover over the badge for details.

#### 🧠 Memory Pruning + Decay (Tier 4.2)

Each AI agent (Bull, Bear, Trader, Judge, Portfolio Manager) keeps a journal of past situations + lessons in BM25-indexed JSON files at `~/.tradingagents/memory/`. When a new analysis runs, the most lexically-similar past lessons get retrieved and injected into the prompt as context.

The risk: **stale lessons pollute decisions.** A 2024 bull-market lesson ("buy IT on dollar weakness") may be wrong in a 2026 bear regime. BM25 alone has no concept of staleness.

Tier 4.2 fixes this with two mechanisms:

**1. Automatic age-based decay** — Every retrieval applies a multiplier:

```
final_score = max(0, BM25_score) × decay_factor

decay_factor:
  age ≤ 30 days     → 1.00 (full weight)
  30 < age ≤ 365    → linear decay 1.00 → 0.20
  age > 365 days    → 0.20 (floor)
  + 1.25× bonus if accessed in last 7 days (frecency)
```

So a 30-day-old lesson with BM25 score 8 wins over a 400-day-old lesson with score 9, even though the older one matched slightly better lexically.

**2. Manual pruning** at `/memory-admin`:

| Criterion | What it removes |
|-----------|-----------------|
| `max_age_days` | Hard cutoff (e.g., 540 = drop entries older than 18 months) |
| `min_hits` | Entries past the 30-day grace period that have been retrieved fewer than N times — catches lessons that turned out to be irrelevant |
| `min_decay` | Entries whose current decay is below this floor (e.g., 0.30) |

Always run **dry-run** first to preview. Pruning is irreversible.

The page also exposes per-agent stats (active / decayed / stale / never_hit) and lets you delete individual entries by index. Pre-existing memory files auto-migrate on first load — they're stamped with the current timestamp and zero hit count, so legacy data is preserved but starts collecting metadata going forward.

#### ⚖️ Confidence Calibration — Brier score

The recommender attaches a `success_probability` (e.g., 65%) to every pick. This page checks whether that number is *honest* — when it says 65%, do trades actually win 65% of the time?

**Brier score** is the single-number measure:

```
brier = mean((predicted_prob - actual_outcome)²)
```

Lower is better. Reference points:

| Brier | Quality |
|-------|---------|
| ≤ 0.15 | excellent |
| ≤ 0.20 | good |
| ≤ 0.25 | fair (always-predict-50% baseline) |
| > 0.25 | poor — worse than random |

**Reliability diagram** bins trades by predicted probability (50–60%, 60–70%, …) and shows actual win rate per bucket. Perfect calibration = bars match the bucket midpoint. Overconfidence shows as bars *below* (engine claims 70%, reality is 55%). Underconfidence is the opposite.

**Verdict** compares overall predicted vs actual:

- **Overconfident** (gap < -5%): mentally derate displayed probabilities. Engine says 70% with -10% gap → treat as 60%.
- **Underconfident** (gap > +5%): trust the engine more on high-prob calls; you can size up.
- **Well-calibrated** (|gap| ≤ 5%): the numbers are honest, use them as-is.

After ~50 closed trades the picture stabilizes. Re-check monthly — calibration drifts as the engine's input distribution shifts.

#### 👁️ Shadow Trades — counterfactual learning

Without this, you only learn from picks you took. Every winner you skipped is invisible — false negatives that quietly poison your filtering instincts.

Every time the recommender produces a STRONG BUY (or HIGH-confidence BUY), the system **auto-records it as a shadow trade** regardless of whether you clicked Track. After 1/3/5/10 trading days, actual P&L backfills via yfinance.

The page splits stats into 4 buckets:

| Bucket | What it measures |
|--------|------------------|
| All shadow trades | Recommender's true win rate, independent of user behavior |
| You tracked | Subset where you opened a paper trade |
| You **skipped** | Subset where you didn't act |
| STRONG BUYs only | Highest-conviction picks separated from BUYs |

**Filter verdict** compares skipped vs tracked win rate:

- **Filter helps** (skipped < tracked by 10%+): your selectivity is adding value
- **Filter neutral** (within 10%): no measurable edge yet
- **Filter HURTS** (skipped > tracked by 10%+): you're systematically skipping winners — trust the recommender more

The trade table shows every shadow with its regime tag and per-horizon P&L. Rows where `user_tracked = ✗` and 5d P&L is large positive are the most painful — picks you skipped that turned into winners. Reviewing these reveals what your gut filter is missing.

## Tech Stack

**Backend:**
- Python 3.10+
- LangGraph (multi-agent orchestration)
- LangChain (LLM integrations)
- FastAPI + Uvicorn
- SQLite (local storage)
- yfinance (free stock data)
- feedparser (RSS parsing)

**Frontend:**
- Next.js 16 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui (component library)
- TradingView lightweight-charts
- Zustand (state management)

**LLM Providers Supported:**
- Anthropic Claude (default — Haiku + Sonnet mix for cost efficiency)
- OpenAI GPT
- Google Gemini
- xAI Grok
- DeepSeek
- Qwen

---

## Cost Optimization

The default configuration uses a **cost-efficient model mix**:
- **Haiku 4.5** for 13 fast tasks (analyst tool-calls, debates, risk analysis)
- **Sonnet 4** for 2 critical decision points (Research Manager, Portfolio Manager)

**Typical cost per analysis:**

| Config | Cost | Duration |
|--------|------|----------|
| Minimal (Market only, Shallow, English) | ~Rs.8-12 | ~1 min |
| Balanced (all 4 analysts, Shallow) | ~Rs.15-25 | 2-3 min |
| Full (all 4 analysts, Deep 3 rounds) | ~Rs.50-70 | 4-6 min |

Switch providers (OpenAI GPT-5.4-mini, Gemini Flash) for even cheaper analyses (~Rs.3-8 per analysis).

---

## Security & Privacy

- **All data stays local**: SQLite DB at `~/.tradingagents/trading_agent.db`, memory files at `~/.tradingagents/memory/`
- **API keys never transmitted**: stored locally, sent only to your chosen LLM provider directly
- **No tracking, no telemetry, no ads**
- **Masked display**: API keys in the Settings UI show only first 10 and last 4 characters

## Contributing

Contributions welcome! Areas that need work:

- Indian market-specific data sources (NSE scraping for bulk/block deals, delivery %, promoter activity)
- Options/F&O analyzer (Phase 3)
- Kite API integration (Phase 4)
- More RSS sources, better news deduplication
- Additional strategies (VWAP, ORB intraday, momentum breakouts)
- Testing infrastructure

Please ensure:
1. No API keys or secrets committed
2. Code follows existing patterns (see `CLAUDE.md`)
3. New features have user-facing documentation (help sections)

## Disclaimer (again, because it matters)

This software is provided **"as-is"** without warranty of any kind. The AI models can and do make mistakes, especially around:
- Sudden market events (RBI announcements, global shocks)
- Illiquid or penny stocks
- Options/derivatives analysis
- Tax and regulatory implications

**Always**:
- Validate AI recommendations against your own research
- Use stop-losses (the AI suggests them; actually place them)
- Never risk more than 1-2% of capital per trade
- Start with paper trading or very small positions
- Consult a SEBI-registered investment advisor for personalized advice

Trading in financial markets carries substantial risk. Past performance — whether historical backtests or agent learning — does not guarantee future results.
